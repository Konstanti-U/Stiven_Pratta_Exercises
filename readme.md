# Stiven_Pratta_Exercises
The solution to programming exercises from the Stephen Pratta textbook (C language, lectures and exercises).

Hello, world! I'm a programmer who study C language and I help everyone else studying this book to solve C exercises.

I will try to make the solved exercises structured for you so that everyone can comfortably look at and study the difficult task. (I hope that I can solve all exercises for you:)))

Good luck!
